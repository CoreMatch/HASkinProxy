# HASkinProxy Development Guide

`HASkinProxy` is a lightweight compatibility layer designed to bridge the gap between Yggdrasil-compliant authentication services and Minecraft clients using the CustomSkinLoader (CSL) protocol.

## Overview

The proxy translates standard Yggdrasil API responses into the CSL JSON format. This allows players to use custom skins and capes on servers that implement the Yggdrasil protocol without requiring the authentication server to natively support CSL.

### Architecture Flow

1. **Username to UUID Resolution**: 
   The proxy receives a request for `{username}.json`. It calls the upstream's `/api/profiles/minecraft` endpoint to resolve the username to a UUID.
2. **Profile Retrieval**:
   Using the UUID, the proxy fetches the full Yggdrasil profile from `/sessionserver/session/minecraft/profile/{uuid}`.
3. **Protocol Translation**:
   The base64-encoded `textures` property in the Yggdrasil profile is decoded. The proxy extracts the skin and cape URLs/hashes and re-packages them into the CSL JSON format.
4. **Texture Forwarding**:
   Requests for `/textures/{hash}` are proxied to the original texture storage (e.g., Mojang or the upstream's storage).
5. **Caching Layer**:
   To minimize upstream load, the proxy implements an in-memory cache using `freecache` for both profile data and texture metadata.

## Configuration

Runtime configuration of the HASkinProxy service (configuration file and its
sections) is documented in the
[HASkinProxy repository README](https://github.com/CoreMatch/HASkinProxy).

## Implementation Details

- **Language**: Go (1.20+)
- **Framework**: Gin Gonic
- **Caching**: freecache
- **Compliance**:
  - Upstream: [Yggdrasil API](https://github.com/yushijinhun/authlib-injector/wiki/Yggdrasil-API-Reference)
  - Downstream: [CustomSkinAPI](../../references/CustomSkinAPI.md)

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness probe. |
| `GET` | `/{username}` | CSL profile (read-through cache). |
| `GET` | `/textures/{hash}` | Raw texture bytes (read-through cache). |
| `POST` | `/{username}/texture/delete` | Legacy passthrough for upstreams that still expose `POST /texture/delete`. |

The CustomSkinLoader setup page is not served as a runtime route anymore: it
is shipped as a compile-time SDK package (`sdk/` in this repo, embedded into
the binary and uploaded to HRPAuth on startup, see
[HRPAuth sdk-package.md](../HRPAuth/sdk-package.md)).

### Texture Management Passthrough (Legacy Compatibility)

`POST /{username}/texture/delete` is a transparent forwarder to an upstream
legacy business endpoint `POST /texture/delete`. The proxy itself does **not**
authenticate requests; the `Authorization` header and the request body are
forwarded verbatim. The upstream response (status code and JSON body) is
returned to the client unchanged.

This passthrough is **not part of the current `HRPAuth-Yggdrasil-API` active
contract**. The current Yggdrasil service exposes profile-state deletion as
`DELETE /texture/delete/{uuid}/{type}`. Until HASkinProxy is migrated, this
endpoint should be treated as compatibility-only for legacy upstreams.

The forwarded request targets `{upstream.base_url}/yggdrasil-api/texture/delete`
(i.e. through the HRPAuth core `/yggdrasil-api` relay prefix). Against the
current HA upstream this path is not registered, so the forwarder receives a
404.

`:username` is used only to evict local cache entries on success:

- `profile:{username}` is removed unconditionally on upstream 2xx.
- `tex:{hash}` entries belonging to that profile (captured before the upstream call from the cached CSL profile) are also removed, so subsequent `GET /textures/{hash}` calls and CSL profile fetches reflect the deletion without waiting for TTL expiry.

On non-2xx upstream responses, no cache eviction occurs. On network errors to the upstream, the proxy responds `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": "..."}`.

## Integration with HA System

While generic in nature, `HASkinProxy` is a key component in the HA ecosystem, serving as the primary skin delivery mechanism for clients that do not support Yggdrasil-based skin loading directly.

### Startup Credential Resolution

The configured `upstream` credentials are classified at startup through the core's RFC 7591 protected registration endpoint `POST /oauth/register` (`client_secret_basic`), after a token-less presence bootstrap. Super credentials are exchanged for this service's own low-privilege client (`client_id` = presence name) and discarded from memory; the config file is rewritten atomically with the new pair (`.bak`, 0600) unless the deployment is entrypoint-rendered (`CONFIG_TEMPLATE`/`RENDERED_CONFIG`, WARN only). Already-low-privilege credentials are verified via a `client_credentials` token request and reused unchanged (no exchange, no write-back). Any resolution failure aborts startup (contract `hrpauth-business.yaml` `/oauth/register`).
